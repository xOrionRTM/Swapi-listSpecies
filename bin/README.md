This assignment is designed to understand how you work and what your preferences are. Don't feel nervous, there is no a correct answer, the source code may not compile and you can search in Google and Stackoverflow, we also do it!!

Here the assignment:

This project lists every character of all Star Wars movies, using the following REST API https://swapi.dev/ 

Your task is the following: Modify this project to list character name and specie. For example:

```
2018-04-09 10:04:52 [swapi.Main.main()] INFO  swapi.Main - Luke Skywalker - Human
```
Warning:
 * There is a bug in the API. It returns urls with http but it is only accessible by https.

Hints:

 * Reuse code of project
 * You may need another call to REST API to get specie. Check API documentation
 * One character may have zero or one specie. You can just print the first one or print "Unknown"

You can test project with following command:

```
$ mvn exec:java
``` 
 
As extra points:

Add a TODO file explaining what more you will do if you would have more than 30 minutes. This is important.

Add a very short README file explaining how to compile it, deploy it and use it. It may empty if you don't have time to do it, no problem at all. We'll discuss it later.
Some things you must consider:

If you are not familiar to git, this may take longer that expected. It's better to upload just one thing than nothing because lack of time.
Use English where you can use it.

Java and Groovy are our favourites languages.

Ask to your interviewer whatever you want, we are here to help.

Good luck and take it easy!
